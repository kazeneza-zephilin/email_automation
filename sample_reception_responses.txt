RESPONSE EMAIL 2 - REGRETFUL DECLINE
==================================================

Subject: Re: Event: Annual Diplomatic Reception - RSVP Required

From: ambassador@embassy-sweden.gov
To: protocol@embassy-usa.gov

Dear Ms. Johnson,

We acknowledge receipt of your invitation to the Annual Diplomatic Reception and deeply appreciate the Embassy's thoughtful gesture in extending this invitation.

Unfortunately, I cannot attend due to a previously scheduled state visit by the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs during the same period. This official obligation prevents our participation in what promises to be a memorable celebration.

No, I will not be able to attend this reception. However, we would be honored to send our congratulations and best wishes for American Independence Day.

We remain committed to strengthening Swedish-American diplomatic relations and hope to participate in future embassy events.

Please accept our sincere regrets and warmest wishes for a successful reception.

Respectfully yours,
Her Excellency Anna Lindberg

Dear Ms. Johnson,

Thank you for the invitation to the Annual Diplomatic Reception. The Australian Embassy values the strong alliance between our nations and appreciates this opportunity for diplomatic engagement.

I am tentative regarding our attendance as we are currently awaiting confirmation of the Ambassador's return from Canberra. Her Excellency is scheduled to conclude urgent consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs on July 19th.

Maybe I will be able to attend, pending final confirmation of the Ambassador's travel arrangements. I will provide definitive confirmation by July 17, 2025, once her schedule is confirmed.

Should we attend, our delegation would consist of:
- Deputy Chief of Mission (myself)
- Trade Commissioner Mr. Michael Thompson

We appreciate your understanding regarding this tentative response and will communicate our final decision promptly.

With sincere appreciation,
Mr. David Richardson
